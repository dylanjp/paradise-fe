# No Testing Framework

This project does not use any testing framework. Do not:

- Add Jest, Vitest, Mocha, or any other test runner
- Create test files or test directories
- Add testing-related dependencies (e.g. @testing-library, jest-dom, etc.)
- Add test scripts to package.json
- Suggest writing tests as part of any implementation

This is an intentional project decision, not an oversight.
