This video is a recording of my presentation “Introduction to Unreal Engine & Blueprints: You Want to Use Blueprints, Trust Me” delivered to the Timpanogos Game Dev Group in Utah on January 30, 2024. In the talk, I introduce the basics of Unreal Engine and explain why Blueprints — Unreal’s visual scripting system — are such a powerful, accessible way to build gameplay without needing deep programming experience. I walk through real examples, core concepts, and practical tips to help new developers prototype faster and work more creatively inside Unreal.

The presentation was also featured in the local newspaper, highlighting the growing interest in game development within the Utah community. This video is a great starting point for anyone curious about learning Unreal Engine or leveling up their Blueprint skills.
